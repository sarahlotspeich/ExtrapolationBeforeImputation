# Itâ€™s integral: Replacing the trapezoidal rule to remove bias and correctly impute censored covariates with their conditional means

This repository contains R code and simulation data to reproduce results from the manuscript by Lotspeich and Garcia (2022+). 

For the `imputeCensRd` package, which implements the conditional mean imputation approaches from the paper, can be found in its own repo [here](https://github.com/sarahlotspeich/imputeCensRd). 

Each of the "Script (Run Simulations)" files is coded to run 1 replication of each setting for demonstration. Per the NOTES at the bottom of the scripts, simulations for Tables 2-S1 and Figures S2-S5 were run in parallel.

**Figure S2.** With Weibull $X$, extrapolating Breslow's estimator $\widehat{S}_0(t)$ beyond the largest uncensored value $\widetilde{X}$ with the Weibull extension offered the lowest bias and best efficiency for $\hat{\beta}$ in conditional mean imputation with adaptive quadrature.

**Figure S3.** With log-normal $X$, extrapolating Breslow's estimator $\widehat{S}_0(t)$ beyond the largest uncensored value $\widetilde{X}$ with any of the three extrapolation methods offered similar bias and efficiency for $\hat{\beta}$ in conditional mean imputation with adaptive quadrature.

**Figure S4.** Interpolating Breslow's estimator $\widehat{S}_0(t)$ between uncensored values with either of the two interpolation methods offered similar bias and efficiency for $\hat{\beta}$ in conditional mean imputation with adaptive quadrature.

**Figure S5.** Extrapolating Breslow's estimator $\widehat{S}_0(t)$ beyond the largest uncensored value $\widetilde{X}$ with any of the three extrapolation methods offered similar bias and efficiency for $\hat{\beta}$ in conditional mean imputation with the trapezoidal rule.

**Figure S6.** Due to the Weibull distribution's skewness, higher censoring rates led to smaller values of $W_{(n)}$ (the maximum of the observed covariate), which led to worse performance (i.e., higher bias) when calculating the conditional mean with the trapezoidal rule.
